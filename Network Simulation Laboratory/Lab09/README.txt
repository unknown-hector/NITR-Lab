1.Compare the performance of AODV, DSR, and DSDV in terms of: 
a)ReceiveRate
b)PacketsReceived 
c)NumberOfSinks
d)RoutingProtocol
e)TransmissionPower
2.Plot graphs for comparison finding the best protocol based on your analysis by proving it considering your generated graph.
3. Enable Flow monitor and Ascii trace metrics (AODV and DSDV).
4. Use the python element tree to parse the generated .flowmon file and find the following.
•FlowId
•Source-address 
•Destination-address
•Flow bit rates 
•Delay mean
•txBitrate
•rxBitrate
•PacketLossRatio
Explain the result of the .tr file using TraceMetrics
