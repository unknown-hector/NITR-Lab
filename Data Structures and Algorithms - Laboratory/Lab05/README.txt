Q1. Write a program to convert a sparse matrix from a 2D array into
A. An array representation of nx3 size, where n is the number of non-zero elements in the
sparse matrix and each element is represented by row, column, and data.
B. A chain list (Linked list representation of the sparse matrix where each non-zero element
is represented by a node containing the data, row, column, and a pointer)

Q2. Write a program to transpose a sparse matrix represented as an array of nx3 size, as
mentioned in problem 1.A. The time complexity of the algorithm should be order of n and the
space complexity should be order of 1.

Q3. Due to a rush at the end of the exam, Professor could not arrange the answer sheets in the
sequence as desired. However, he mentioned the correct location of each answer sheet with it.
Now, Professor wants all the answer sheets in the desired sequence.
Hint:

Q4. Write a program to implement a searching algorithm on a skip list having two layers as
shown in below figure:
Assume that the linked list is already sorted. Write your observations on the time complexity of
the algorithm.
