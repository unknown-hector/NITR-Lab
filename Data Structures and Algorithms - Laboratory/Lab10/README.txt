Q1. Write a program to implement an AVL Tree having following functionalities.
 Insert (): This function inserts a new node to an AVL tree. The node contains an integer type of data.
 BF(): This function returns the balance factor of a given node.
 LL(): This function performs LL rotation.
 RR(): This function performs RR rotation.
 LR(): This function performs LR rotation.
 RL(): This function performs RL rotation.
 Display (): This function displays inorder traversal sequence of the AVL tree.
After inserting a new node, if the resulting tree is not AVL then insert function calls appropriated rotation function
to make the tree an AVL
