Q1. A positive integer is entered through the keyboard; write a recursive function to obtain the
prime factors of that integer. Also, analyse the time and space complexity of your algorithm.

Q2. Design a recursive algorithm to search a sorted array a for an element x between a[low] and
a[high]. If no element is found it returns -1. Also, analyse the time and space complexity of your
algorithm.

Q3. WAP to implement the Linear linked list. Perform the following operations on the linked
list:
 Creating an empty linked list
 Adding the numbers at the beginning of the linked list.
 Addition of numbers after a particular location.
 Counting the no of nodes.
 Displaying the linked list.

Q4. Write a program that inserts 25 random integers from 0 to 100 in sorted order in a linked list.
The program should calculate the sum of the elements and the floating-point average of the
elements.
Example:
The list is: 6 12 14 20 27 31 31 34 37 38 56 59 63 66 72 73 73 76 77 79 88 94 95 96 97 *
The sum is: 1414
The average is: 56.560000
