Q.Write a tcl script to create a wireless scenario with following constraints:
o 12nodes (nod1 to nod12) 
o Initial position of nodes should be such that all the nodes are placed on the line x-y=0 in the order: nod1, nod4, nod2, nod3,
 nod5, nod6, nod7, nod8, nod9, nod10, nod11and nod12(all node are equidistant to each other).
o AODV Routing protocol is used 802.11 macotwo-ray ground radio propagation modelopriority queue with queue length of 15oomni-directional antenna
o topology of 800 X 800.other simulation stops at 100soTraffic generation: node nod1 acting as FTP traffic generator;
•start at time 0.1s.
•packetSize 1024bytes•fid 1
•node nod12acting as receiver Node nod5 acting as CBR and FTP traffic generator:
•start at time 0.5 for CBR and 0.75 for FTP
•fid 2•node nod1 acting as receiver for FTP traffic and nod 12acting as receiver for CBRoTurn on agent and router tracing.
o Turn mac tracing to off.


Find the following usingAWK scripts:

a.)Calculate the numberof packets sent for different flow.
b.)How many packets are dropped?
